This is a matlab code package is related to our article: "Path Selection and Rate Allocation in Self-Backhauled mmWave Networks",  Proc. IEEE Wireless Commun. Netw. Conf., Apr. 2018, pp. 2371-2376, 15-18 April 2018, Barcelona, Spain. http://wcnc2018.ieee-wcnc.org/

*Title*: Path Selection and Rate Allocation in Self-Backhauled mmWave Networks


#Authors: Trung Kien Vu

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces all the numerical results and figures in the article. We encourage you to also perform reproducible research!

Note that this is the first version of our draft to show an example of learning path. The full source code will be uploaded later.

*Content of Code Package*

The paper contains three simulation figures:

Figure 2 is generated by the Matlab script main.m or main_0.m


See each file for further documentation. Note that this package constains a simple procedure that allows to learning the path/route in our paper. You can modify further based on this outlines
